## 2026-07-01 - Bootstrap: Deterministic Orchestration Foundation

Completed the initial repository bootstrap as a Python 3.12+ project with an installable `rtl-agent` CLI, typed YAML configuration, artifact-backed named command execution, a durable run store, a narrow Git worktree abstraction, tests, and canonical validation script.

Validation evidence:

- `python3 scripts/check.py` - passed: Ruff format check, Ruff lint, mypy strict type checking, and 11 pytest tests.
- `.venv/bin/rtl-agent --help` - passed.
- `.venv/bin/rtl-agent init` - passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m rtl_agent --help` - passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m rtl_agent inspect-config --config examples/rtl-agent.yaml` - passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m rtl_agent run-command --config examples/rtl-agent.yaml --command smoke` - passed and wrote run artifacts under `.rtl-agent/runs/20260701T211537Z-9828a455/`.

Architectural decisions:

- Commands are executed only by configured name and use `subprocess.run(..., shell=False)`.
- Large stdout/stderr are written to command artifact files instead of retained in memory.
- Configuration paths resolve relative to the config file location.
- Git worktree support is intentionally limited to validation, path planning, create, and remove; no commits, pushes, remotes, or branch automation.

Known limitations:

- No RTL repository discovery yet.
- No AI coding agent or model-provider abstraction yet.
- No EDA-specific tool integration beyond deterministic configured commands.
