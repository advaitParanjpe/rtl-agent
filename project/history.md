# History

Append only. Keep entries compact: milestone, decisions, validation evidence, and known limitations.

## 2026-07-01 - Bootstrap: Deterministic Orchestration Foundation

Completed the initial repository bootstrap as a Python 3.12+ project with an installable `rtl-agent` CLI, typed YAML configuration, artifact-backed named command execution, a durable run store, a narrow Git worktree abstraction, tests, and canonical validation script.

Validation evidence:

- `python3 scripts/check.py` - passed: Ruff format check, Ruff lint, mypy strict type checking, and 11 pytest tests.
- `.venv/bin/rtl-agent --help` - passed.
- `.venv/bin/rtl-agent init` - passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m rtl_agent --help` - passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m rtl_agent inspect-config --config examples/rtl-agent.yaml` - passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m rtl_agent run-command --config examples/rtl-agent.yaml --command smoke` - passed and wrote run artifacts under `.rtl-agent/runs/20260701T211537Z-9828a455/`.

Architectural decisions:

- Commands are executed only by configured name and use `subprocess.run(..., shell=False)`.
- Large stdout/stderr are written to command artifact files instead of retained in memory.
- Configuration paths resolve relative to the config file location.
- Git worktree support is intentionally limited to validation, path planning, create, and remove; no commits, pushes, remotes, or branch automation.

Known limitations:

- No RTL repository discovery yet.
- No AI coding agent or model-provider abstraction yet.
- No EDA-specific tool integration beyond deterministic configured commands.

## 2026-07-01 - RTL Repository Discovery and Structured Repository Model

Completed deterministic RTL repository discovery with a typed, versioned repository-map JSON schema, bounded scanner, lightweight SystemVerilog declaration and instantiation parser, hierarchy candidate scoring, build/verification command evidence extraction, Git metadata discovery, CLI entry points, run-artifact integration, tests, and README usage.

Validation evidence:

- `python3 scripts/check.py` - passed: Ruff format check, Ruff lint, mypy strict type checking, and 22 pytest tests.
- `.venv/bin/python -m rtl_agent discover --config examples/rtl-agent.yaml` - passed and wrote `.rtl-agent/runs/<run-id>/discovery/repository-map.json`.
- `.venv/bin/rtl-agent inspect-repo --repo examples/simple-rtl --output .rtl-agent/simple-rtl-map.json` - passed; inspected JSON reported schema version 1, 7 files, 4 declarations, 2 discovered commands, design top candidates, and testbench candidates.
- `.venv/bin/rtl-agent inspect-repo --repo . --output .rtl-agent/self-map.json` - passed gracefully on the Python-heavy `rtl-agent` repository.
- `git diff --check` - passed.

Architectural decisions:

- Discovery is deterministic and filesystem-based; it never executes discovered repository commands.
- Scanner enforces default exclusions, configurable include/exclude patterns, maximum file count, maximum text file size, binary skipping, and safe symlink handling.
- SystemVerilog support is intentionally lightweight: comments and strings are masked before regex extraction, with parser notes recorded in the map.
- Top-level modules are scored candidates with reasons rather than asserted facts.
- `src/rtl_agent/artifacts` is tracked after narrowing the root artifact ignore rule.

Known limitations:

- No full SystemVerilog preprocessing, elaboration, parameter resolution, generate expansion, or semantic compilation.
- Build discovery records command evidence but does not integrate or run EDA tools.
- No issue parsing, task contracts, AI coding agent, or model-provider abstraction yet.
